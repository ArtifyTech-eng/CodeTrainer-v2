Thank you for using CodeTrainer v2.

Firstly, i would like to start by stating: DO NOT TOUCH ANY JSON FILE! Any unnecessary changes in the codes can break the mainfile completely.
It has a total of 650 LOC with over 20 files sharing data across each other.
Secondly, do not rename anything. As i said, everything is set up perfectly, any change can break the .exe .

Quick comparison with version 1:

150 LOC --- 650 LOC / improved - added new features and language.
Performance, CodeTrainer v2 gets the lead here by faster running time, smooth.
Visuals / Used colorama on CodeTrainer v2.
Modular Coding - V1 had very small amounts of data sitting, V2 takes the lead here by 20 files.

Enjoy this version!
